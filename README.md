# VICTRE_MO: Model Observers for VICTRE
This package, named VICTRE-MO, contains open-source model observer functions to perform location-known lesion detection tasks. The codes were written in Mathworksâ€™ MATLAB language. Channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) [1,2] and convolution CHO [3]with Laguerre-Gauss channels were implemented in this package. Contact for questions: Rongping Zeng rongping.zeng@fda.hhs.gov
